Enterprise Architecture Policies and Guiding Principles

Enterprise Architecture Policies |   Business Principles |   Information Principles |   Security Principles |   System Principles |   Technology Principles
Enterprise architecture policies and principles guide technology advancements for the enterprise. They provide a set of governing statements which emphasize shared values, setting direction for design and the deployment of technology.
Policy	Policy Overview	Policy Implementation	Notes
 Solution Alignment	
- Align solution designs to ‘North Stars’ (future state provided by the Architecture Planning team) where such exist; maximizing synergies, minimizing global costs and risks
- Leverage Ecosystem Platform capabilities where at all possible (current and future state provided by the Architecture Planning team); part of ensuring a seamless consumer experience across the total Aetna ecosystem
- Have knowledge of Enterprise Blueprints relevant to solution design (or participate in the weekly collaboration meetings)
- Use designated enterprise components where available, including Ecosystem Platform capabilities
- Discuss, record and manage deviations from policy as architecture exceptions (Level 2 is the Daily Risk Review meeting, Level 3 is the formal EA Governance process)
- Participation in continued evolution of the ‘North Stars’ is encouraged through collaboration with the Architecture Planning team under Joe Arnold (nobody has all the answers in advance, future state keeps evolving)
- Where desired, the Architecture Forensics team under Bob Bates is available to assist with a deep dive into current business processes and IT platforms
 Sourcing of Data	
- Align choice of data source (when multiple options) with Source of Record and Source of Truth designations in the Enterprise Blueprints (future state provided by the Architecture Planning team) where such exist
- Do not use Systems of Insight as an operational data source; do not “write back updates”
- Ensure that the data owner agrees with the intended data usage and that regulatory requirements are being met
- Ensure visibility for data usage and data dependencies across the Aetna integration fabric (including caching, replication and duplication)
- Have knowledge of ‘North Stars’ relevant to data sourcing design
- Ensure appropriate dialog with the Data Usage Governance team (and/or use the EA integration leads as proxies)
- Record data sourcing designs in the designated Enterprise Integration Repository
- Discuss, record and manage deviations from policy as architecture exceptions (Level 2 is the Daily Risk Review meeting, Level 3 is the formal EA Governance process)
- Participation in continued evolution of the ‘North Stars’ is encouraged through collaboration with the Architecture Planning team under Joe Arnold (nobody has all the answers in advance, future state keeps evolving)
 Integration Patterns	
- Use standard integration patterns (with built in security and identity characteristics)
- Follow Global Identity standards
- All cross-domain (incl. to 3rd party platforms) real time integrations must go through a managed API, with operational traffic management policies applied
- Develop and operate business logic according to data affinity (rather than copy data)
- Have knowledge of standard integration patterns and Global Identity standards
- For non-standard integration patterns, ensure that security and global identity requirements are being met (through discussion with Global Security and the EA Integration Leads respectively)
- Discuss, record and manage deviations from policy as architecture exceptions (Level 2 is the Daily Risk Review meeting, Level 3 is the formal EA Governance process)
- Standard integration patterns are developed by the EA Integration Leads in collaboration with Global Security; input and participation from the broader architecture community is encouraged and welcome
- Standard integration patterns have pre-approved security characteristics; Global Security assessment is generally not required for integrations using these patterns
 Operational Stability	
- Ensure that (non-functional) IT operational needs are met; globally for shared components (including enterprise services), locally for other parts of a solution or integration design
- In cases where manual processes are impacted by a solution design, ensure that business operational concerns and needs are addressed
- All cross-domain (incl. to 3rd party platforms) real time integrations must go through a managed API, with operational traffic management policies applied
- Communicate capacity and stability impacts to the Infrastructure Engineering and IT Operations teams
- Ensure that business owners accept operational risk in cases with business operational impact from a solution or integration design
- Record non-functional characteristics as part of solution and integration designs in the designated Enterprise Documentation Repository (NEAR) and Integration Repository
- Discuss, record and manage deviations from policy as architecture exceptions (Level 2 is the Daily Risk Review meeting, Level 3 is the formal EA Governance process)
- Where desired, the Architecture Forensics team under Bob Bates is available to assist with a deep dive into current business processes and IT platforms
 Documentation	
- Ensure that current state documentation is always up to date
- Ensure that solution and integration designs, as well as current state documentation, follow applicable documentation standards
- Before release to production, update current state documentation for both Solution and Integration designs in the designated Enterprise Documentation Repository (NEAR)
- During development, for in-flight work, share designs with cross team impact in the designated Program Design Repository; for designs with cross program impact share in the Enterprise Design Repository
- Documentation standards are generally produced by EA and focus on segmentation and structure of content, not form or tool
- Documentation standards cater to both development and operational needs
- Programs can select a different Design Repository than the enterprise standard, but must also share designs with cross program impact in the Enterprise Design Repository
- Participation in the continued evolution of the documentation standards is encouraged through collaboration with the Architecture Delivery team under Rob Baigert (as the nature of systems and platforms change, so must associated documentation)
 Enterprise Capabilities	
- Ensure that the design of enterprise components, aka components that will be used by multiple programs, follows applicable ‘North Stars’ (future state provided by the Architecture Planning team)
- Ensure that enterprise needs are taken into account in solution and integration designs for enterprise components; known requirements will be provided by the EA teams (Architecture Planning as well as Delivery Architects on other programs) and by any business owners engaged in the discussions
- Discuss, record and manage deviations from policy as architecture exceptions (Level 2 is the Daily Risk Review meeting, Level 3 is the formal EA Governance process)
- If necessary log and follow up on technical debt and missing capabilities, including an active plan and timeline for elimination of the issue
- The Architecture Planning team adjudicates what constitutes an Enterprise Component, based on current Enterprise Blueprints as well as known requirements from programs across all of Aetna
- The first iterations of enterprise components can be (and are), when necessary, built with limited capabilities, but decisions should always be made with explicit knowledge of how current implementation deviates from known enterprise need

Principle	Statement of principle	Rationale	Implications
 Comply with consistent standards and guidelines with Business Architecture modeling	This will ensure that a common depiction will be applied and increased understanding of our artifacts will occur.  Consistent standards, tools and common business reference will be applied to all business models.	> Ensures a common depiction and increased understanding of our artifacts, regardless of their type or the breadth of their view (Enterprise, Domain, or Business Unit).	
> Business Process Modeling and formatting should be standardized across the enterprise through use of approved tools (currently, Websphere Business Modeler and Visio).
> Multiple types of models may be utilized depending on the specifics of an engagement; however, a tool-kit should be available for guidance and consistency.
> The APF (Aetna Process Framework) currently represents the common language/vocabulary to Aetna’s Business Processes and sub-processes which are to be referenced and utilized.
 Follow a business process centric approach	Business Processes are foundational to Enterprise Business Architecture.  Subsequently all strategic IT solutions should align to business processes. This ensures a clearer understanding of the impact that a business strategy may trigger.	> Ensures that an enterprise/strategic execution of processes is articulated.
> Ensures a clearer understanding of the impact that a business strategy may trigger.
> Ensures IT solutions delivered are aligned to business processes.  
> Promotes traceability and tracking of Business Needs.
> Enables a logical decomposition and understanding of Business Needs and Expanded Business Needs to occur.	
> APF (Aetna Process Framework) alignment, traceability and status must exist until the Business Need has been satisfied.
> Traceability maintenance / ownership needs to occur throughout Aetna’s project life cycle.
> Currently, traceability is a manual effort and not done consistently
 Promote Traceability from Business Strategy	The initiation of traceability will begin with the Business Strategy and cascade through strategy implementation.  Traceability must be maintained as capabilities and business needs are aligned to programs, solutions, projects, business requirements and through point of realization.	
>The initiation of traceability to components of the Business Strategy (capabilities, needs, projects) promotes the downstream measurement of strategy implementation.
> Promotes accountability of strategy results.
> Promotes sophisticated tracking mechanisms.
> Enables a logical decomposition and association of strategy components.
> Traceability is currently a manual effort via spreadsheets.
> Linkage to downstream portions of traceability (Rational) must still be developed.
> Traceability maintenance / ownership needs to occur throughout Aetna’s project life cycle.
 Utilize a Strategic and Holistic Approach	A strategic and holistic approach to business architecture will be maintained to maximize business benefit.  Cross business capability/functionality, supporting an enterprise approach will be considered.  This will reduce the insular view of business function while enabling better decision making, reducing spend and increasing return on investments.	
> The value of information is not always realized when it remains in isolated pockets. All opportunities must include business, domain and enterprise analysis for synergistic opportunities and examination of dependencies.
> Business value, breadth and currency will be achieved by leveraging the broader view identified by industry standards, statistics and/or competitor analysis, when applicable.
> Shared information promotes the effectiveness of business decision making throughout the enterprise.
> Infrastructure and support services resulting from stovepipe planning and views are often duplicative and difficult to scale and/or adapt to change.
> The cross business view supports an enterprise approach.  As business processes continue to change, it will be easier and quicker to adapt the IT infrastructure to facilitate this change.
> Clear identification of the authoritative source areas and value-chain will be needed.
> Acceptance that decisions could take longer to make and solutions could require more time to implement.
> Business area or domain occasionally conceding their own preferences for the greater benefit of the ‘big-picture’.
> Near term or immediate return on value may be overlooked with a particular business unit or domain need for IT solution.
 Utilize the Enterprise Business Model	Provide a reference picture of the business that is a simplified view depicting business operations, constituents, business processes, products and services.   	> Reduces risk of process divergence, information currency and inconsistency.
> Highlight points of shared enterprise versus market specific decisions.
> Provides a reference point for business processes and assets across the enterprise.
> Provides the vision of business capabilities and operations required to attain desired constituent experiences.
> Presents a clear line-of-sight and strategic alignment for categorizing investments and managing the IT portfolio.
> Enables a consistent experience and common language for business consumers and IT partners.	
> Aetna’s Business Architecture Framework (EBAF) must be used in deriving business context.
>The APF (Aetna Process Framework) will be referenced and used for Business Process Area and Context definitions and low-level user process workflow depictions.

Principle	Statement of principle	Rationale	Implications
 Build flexibility and extensibility into database design	Logical data models are flexible and extensible in support of evolving business requirements for multiple constituents.  Physical database designs support business performance, accessibility, scalability, data integrity, and availability requirements.  They are designed in support of information services and multiple applications, when appropriate.
> Reduces system and data redundancy.
> Flexible logical designs support evolving business requirements and are the starting point for physical design.
> Allows database designs to more rapidly respond to business volumes and growth.
> Ensures databases support the system performance, scalability and availability requirements.	> All business information requirements need to be logically modeled prior to implementation into a physical database.
> Database design best practices around performance, accessibility, scalability, availability, and recoverability need to be formalized, published and maintained on an ongoing basis.
> Best practices around planned data redundancy and consistency need to be formalized, published and maintained on an ongoing basis.
> Database structures and information services are designed for reusability.
 Ensure Data Quality and Integrity	Data quality and data integrity are required to ensure delivery of complete, accurate, and timely information to business operations and decision support functions.  Data Quality efforts should maximize benefit to the enterprise while taking into account all end-to-end costs/benefits.  Data quality processes must be integrated into business and technical processes in a way that does not interfere with continuity of business functions.  Data Quality must be continuously monitored to ensure proactive corrections and improvements.
> Architects and DBA’s know which database solution to apply based on functional, non-functional and enterprise strategy requirements (e.g., transactional BoR, ODS, Data Mart, etc.)
> Ensures business decisions are based on complete, timely and accurate data.
> Fosters trusted constituent relationships through reliability of reported results.
> Avoids downtime for investigation and recovery resulting from data quality problems or data compromise.	> The Business is responsible for the complete, accurate and timely content of the data.
> Business Subject Matter Experts (SME) are needed to fulfill the role of Business Data Stewards for each domain
> The IT organization is responsible for the complete, accurate, and timely storage, movement and delivery of data.
> The Business is responsible for specifying the level of audit ability required for the data and its associated Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) processes.
> The IT organization is responsible for implementing adequate audit processes to support the audit requirements specified by the business.
> Data quality assurance processes are non functional requirements for every operational and decision support system.
 Manage data across its Life Cycle	
Data will be managed from point of capture, through integration across various information classes, until it is no longer needed. 
For details on this principle, refer to this document: https://aetsps.aetna.com/sites/EIAShr/Governance/Data%20Lifecycle%20Principle.docx
> Prevents (intentional or unintentional) unplanned modification of data, which could lead to inefficient or incorrect business decisions.
> Reduces cost through the efficiencies of maintaining only required data across the enterprise.
> Business retention and performance concerns will be supported.
> Enables compliance with regulations and internal policies (e.g. HIPAA, Sorbanes-Oxley, Aetna Records and Retentions Policy).
> Enables the business to determine when and where their data resides.	> Business requirements will determine when data will move across the lifecycle.
> There will be a managed process for the movement of data across various classes of information systems.
> Must maintain traceability to show origination through final dispensation.
> The Business is responsible for specifying the retention, archival, purge, and recoverability requirements of the data.
> The IT organization is responsible for implementing adequate archival, purge, and recoverability processes to meet the business requirements.
> A strategy for maintenance functions for data in each class needs to be defined and implemented.
 Manage information actively	Enterprise information is managed by developing and publishing the business definition, allowable content, and optimum data structure.   This published metadata is not only used to document our content, but also to control it through exposing the metadata to systems that process it and use it to control editing, validation, data quality,  and similar processes.  Data names and definitions must be unambiguous, contextually unique and understandable to all users. Transformation rules and mappings must be recorded whenever data is converted to another format and/or value.  Information delivery assets (both business and it developed) will be accessible and reusable.	> Data is the foundation of decision-making, and must be managed to ensure that we know where it is, can rely upon its accuracy, and can obtain it when and where we need it.
> Increases the efficiency of delivery of systems and services through clarity of definition and reuse.
> Facilitates adoption of data as an enterprise asset.
> Increases metadata and data integrity.
> Reduces the cost and complexity of business solutions through the use and reuse of clear and common business definitions and valid values.
> Ensures data consistency across all applications.	> Aetna must develop an element registry/naming taxonomy for enterprise data.
> Business Data Stewards must be identified and their roles defined.
> The organizational and technical methods for managing data at the enterprise level must be developed, implemented and adopted.
> Semantic tags (properties) must be developed for all data regardless of presentation medium (web, transaction, data warehouse) providing a method of searching across business silos.
> Aetna methodology must be enhanced to address processes that support enterprise deliverables.
> Aetna must implement a process that supports traceability between logical, Physical, and Information services design artifacts.   In support of re-use, all design artifacts need to be stored and catalogued.
> The Business is responsible for specifying the business definition and the business rules for the data. These rules include cardinality, optionality, and the domain of values.
> The IT organization is responsible for implementing code and data stores that constrain the data to the specified definition, domain, and business rules.
> Data attributes will be described without duplication, reconciling all alternate attribute names to a common definition.
 Meet Data Access Requirements	Information Systems will be designed to support appropriate classes of use.   Information will be maintained in recognized Books of Record, which will publish their information through well-defined interfaces and in standardized formats that support the functional and non-functional requirements of information consumers.   Information is available and timely as appropriate to the end user.	> Reduces the overall cost of ownership for a business solution.
> It is the intent of information system design to satisfy the functional and non-functional requirements of information consumers.
> Definition of authoritative information sources is an enabling concept for Service-Oriented Architecture.
> Prevents (intentional or unintentional) unplanned modification, which leads to dubious decisions based on incorrect information.	> Some business entities may have multiple sources, requiring a federated Book of Record.
> Best practices for data access and usage must be developed and implemented for database designers, application developers and end users.
> Aetna must develop data access best practices that meet the requirements of performance, database characteristics, accessibility and data integration.
> Database access protocols (SQL, xquery) will be applied based on efficient use of the language for performance and function.
> Database solution best practices need to be formalized, published and maintained on an ongoing basis.
 Metadata management is a fundamental aspect of development	Creation, maintenance, and management of metadata is required throughout system development processes.  Metadata is integrated to support business goals (e.g. speed to market and cost efficency).  Standards and methodologies are established and used to inventory and manage business data assets across the enterprise. Business, Operational and Technical metadata are accessible to all consumers to allow them to perform their job.  
> Ensures an efficient, consistent metadata management process across the enterprise.
> Results in common skill sets that can be leveraged across the enterprise.
> Standardizes data management and data analysis activities.
> Allows for creation of standard templates and reusable artifacts, reducing cost and time to delivery.
> Enables the capability to locate critical business data, understand its meaning, rely on data values, trust its accuracy, know its source and use it correctly.
> Manages information assets within the IT portfolio.	> Metadata Management methods, tools and organizations must be developed, adopted and implemented to capture, integrate, manage and deliver metadata.
> Aetna must have a common toolset that enables metadata integration.  Tools are needed to link all metadata components (business, operational, and technical).
> Tools must have the ability to maintain and manage a federated metadata repository.
> Aetna must enhance existing methodology to include the data integration and deliverables for shared enterprise metadata.
> Methods must be established for communicating metadata about shareable data and databases.
> The implementation of basic operational control metrics (record counts, data timestamp) will be a non functional requirement for every data process.
 Place data strategically, use appropriately	Data placement decisions should be based on the business owner (who is executing the business process), the book of record most closely affiliated with this subject area and the application which is automating the business process to maintain the data.  Leverage all tiers of Information Architecture appropriately: transactional/BoR, ODS, DW, Analytics, Information Archives.	> Allows access to integrated and enterprise level data across all business segments for business analysis and decision support based reporting.
> Provides our constituents with access to Aetna’s information.
> Ensures data consistency across all applications.
> Provides the ability to summarize and aggregate for Management Information reporting needs.
> End users should be able to access data without knowledge of where it resides or how it is stored.
> Placement based on business subject areas is stable and subject to minimal redefinition.
> Reduces the cost and complexity of business solutions by having the data placed where it can be maintained, managed and disseminated.
> Increases data integrity and data consistency.
> Increase the efficiency of delivering data to consumers through services.	> Design standards and best practices must be formalized, published, and maintained on an ongoing basis.
> Blueprint development efforts have to be developed and approved for all domains that impact subject area definitions to facilitate data placement direction.
> Enterprise process models need to contain sufficient detail to facilitate data placement decisions.
> Business data stewards for the contents of each subject area need to be assigned and be responsible addressing all requirements that surface for the subject area.
> There must be an ongoing reconciliation of subject area boundaries to domain boundaries.
> Must maintain a mapping of business subject area data by business data steward and by application process, for all business subject areas.
> The full potential of an enterprise data warehouse cannot be realized unless there is enterprise level stakeholder participation and funding.
> The enterprise data warehouse is architected for data analysis and adhoc query access.  It is not designed to support real time applications or operational based reporting.
> The enterprise data warehouse and data marts are sourced from operational and external data to provide an integrated, reliable, and consistent view of data across all of Aetna’s business segments.  It is not a data store for independent Business Owned App.
> Sourced data for the warehouse should be consistent with the Books of Records and operational systems.  The warehouse should not generate definitions of core business concepts (i.e. Individualization).
> Define and publish clear scope and boundaries for each architectural layer and component (What is a Book of Record?  What is an ODS? Etc.)
 Preserve privacy and confidentiality	Data implementations must ensure data privacy and confidentiality.	> Facilitates robust personalization of information portals.
> Supports security and confidentiality polices.
> Avoids (intentional or unintentional) data compromise that may erode the willingness of constituents and business partners to entrust us with their data and that may jeopardize corporate good will.
> Ensures compliance with legislation (such as HIPAA, Gramm-Leach-Bliley) that requires privacy and confidentiality of customer data, based on business data classification and applicable regulations.	> All data should be treated as confidential, unless classified otherwise.  Information Security policies will be complied with. https://securnet.aetna.com/policies/Standards/HandlandProtectData.htm  
> Security infrastructure mechanisms must be consistently deployed to authenticate users to the individual level.
> Security infrastructure mechanisms must be consistently implemented to control access to data, based on “need-to-know” criteria.
> Access to sensitive and confidential data must be audited and archived as required by regulatory requirements and to support potential forensic investigations.
> Encryption for data at rest is a potential solution when access controls alone to do not afford sufficient privacy measures.
> Standard means of securing data (authentication, authorization, encryption, auditing) apply to all users (employees, business partners, constituents).
> Production data must not be used in non-production database environment with the exception of standard reference information.
> The Business is responsible for specifying the security requirements of the data.
> The IT organization is responsible for implementing adequate security for the data Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations, storage, transport, and accessibility.
 Support all forms of data	Information/Data definition, quality controls, access and storage must support all forms of data – simple, complex, structured and unstructured.	> Allows for data structure and information services alignment.
> Facilitates the storage and retrieval of information in its native format (text, audio, image, video, XML).
> Allows for business applications that integrate structured and unstructured content.
> Facilitates the description of data for application use (enterprise B2B and B2C) through self-describing protocols (XML).
> Facilitates content-rich, highly informative decision support and other information providing systems, such as EIS (Executive Information Systems) and EIP (Enterprise Information Portals).	> Data elements must be defined through metadata as structured (character, numeric, date) and unstructured (text, image, audio, video) data.
> Data stores and infrastructure components must scale to support the storage and bandwidth requirements of unstructured data.
> Emerging representational standards such as XML and it’s associated access protocols (xquery) must be supported by our technical infrastructure.
> Aetna must devise processes that support he creation, storage and retrieval of documents, images and other unstructured information-rich objects used within Aetna or exchanged with external organizations and vendors.

> The PESP (produce identification process) assures an objective assessment of technologies and products against immediate business goals. It also provides opportunities to suggest technology solutions that align project objectives with overarching enterprise-level initiatives.
 Technology choices must focus on business enablement and innovation.	A key driver of technology blueprint strategies, evaluations, and acquisitions should be the ability to enable business strategy and innovation, balancing time to market with viability.	
> Ensures technology investments have strategic alignment with evolving business goals.
> Anticipates business needs, allowing quicker response to business initiatives
> Provides agility in support of business growth and changing business strategy.
> Supports quicker time to market
> Proactive enablement of business needs as they happen.
> Product choices that readily adapt to a variety of business scenarios.  
> Positions Aetna to achieve business strategies over the next 3 years
> Avoids constrictive (i.e. proprietary; narrowly focused) or long tailed approaches (i.e. requiring extensive customization or integration work).
 Facilitate integration while increasing options to use pre-built solutions and reducing complexity.	This principle encompasses standards-based integration with Commercially-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solution and external entities to reduce complexity	Standards-based integration reduces complexity, increases speed to market and cost of ownership	
> Technology selection must ensure that we evaluate and select products or service that interoperate with one another using industry standards
> Interoperability using industry standards eliminates one-off connectors or adapters, and reduces the complexity of integration
 Provide loose coupling between applications and infrastructure components	This principle is about eliminating point to point integration between applications and technology components 	
> Loose coupling will reduce application and infrastructure complexity
> Loose coupling will decrease the application maintenance cost and increase the speed to market
> Loose coupling must be enforced while designing and developing applications
> Loose coupling must also be enforced while integrating external vendor products or services with in-house applications.
 Manage Technical Debt effectively.	The addition and removal of technical debt needs to be handled in a purposeful way.	
> All non-strategic acquisitions of technology introduce some level of technical debt
> Managing the level technical debt by retiring or maintaining non-strategic needs to part of a larger plan
> Blueprinting activities need to account for current and proposed technical debt.
> When choosing a non-strategic product, the technical debt issue must be raised during the selection process
> When markets are immature, there will be times when it makes sense to actively pursue solutions that may be used for a limited period of time. The impact of unmanaged solutions of this type may increase considerably if not managed properly.
 Technology must support compliance with Aetna’s policies governing its security, confidentiality, privacy and regulatory requirements	A technology component must never enable security breaches, unduly expose protected information, predispose a configuration that violates Aetna security and data protection policies, or inhibit compliance with existing regulatory controls. Where appropriate, technology components should facilitate compliant behavior and assist in the execution of enterprise governance practices	
> Supports security and confidentiality policies
> Contributes to a compliant information management ecosystem
> Enables compliance with legislation that requires privacy and confidentiality of data, and preservation of business records, as defined by a classification scheme and applicable regulations
> Facilitates compliance with regulatory reporting requirements and the rules governing legal discovery
> Enables use of the technology component by multiple consumers and applications without creating security risks that must be evaluated before an application can be permitted to go into production, thus realizing standardized security models and economies of scale
> Candidate technology must be vetted for its ability to operate according to IT Security mandates, including role-based authorization, access controls, authentication certificates, secured transports, encryption, and the systemic mechanisms that enable these
> Candidate technology must be vetted to ensure that its installation and operating requirements do not presume root access, isolated middle tier, isolated host machine, database system administrative grants, cross-domain access, network administrator privileges, or any other such highly-protected roles
> Candidate technology must not operate opaque to security monitoring, audit, and risk management controls
> Where appropriate, candidate technology must be able to align its behavior with codified and persisted policies
> An established technology should not be reassessed for its security compliance unless there is a significant architectural change presented by a new, major release
> An established technology should not be subject to a reassessment during each project that instantiates its use
> These implications apply to all forms for hosting, including enterprise, on-premises-virtualized, external service providers, and hybrids of these
> These implications apply to all locales where the technology is deployed, i.e. in every nation where Aetna operates as a business and consumes the technology in question
 Provide strategic technology capabilities that can be adopted enterprise-wide.	The benefit of addressing strategic requirements with technology that can be adopted enterprise wide reduces complexity, integration and adoption barriers and provides a consistent technology posture across business, department and external entities.	
> Reduces complexity of integration within the company
> Provides the company with a comprehensive toolkit of applications meeting the broadest requirements
> Promotes adherence to recognized architecture best practices.
> AIS 3 Year Plan: Has the potential for reducing  the number of applications required for each employee to perform enterprise functions such as electronic communication, collaboration and content management
> Allows for a more consistent strategy on technology adoption based upon the current and future requirements and capabilities of the technologies deployed
